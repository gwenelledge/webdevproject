        <p class="aboutmepara">Hello! My name is Gwendolyn Elledge. There are times where I proudly admonish myself
            with the sophistication of a name like Gwendolyn, but I most often go by Gwen.
            I am an avid movie watcher, book reader, and music appreciator, which has given me the
            opportunity to come across a plethora of characters. I find that being able to connect
            to the characters on screen enhances the entertainment and fulfillment that comes from
            viewing their stories. Following this introduction is a list of the characters that I have found
            resemble some part of who I am. I would like to preface this with the disclaimer that I am
            my own person, but seeing yourself in others can help you recognize your potential.

                    <li>I devote a large portion of my time to studying music through focused

                        pop, and instrumentals.

                    <li>I love going on long walks to simply admire the clouds, bright sky, colorful

                        Gethsemane and His sacrifice of life on the cross at Calvary,

        <h3>Gwen Stacy</h3>
        <div class="containerleft">

            <div class="text">
                <p class="characterpara">Gwen Stacy is so much more than the love interest in The Amazing Spider-Man. She is a symbol of courage, intelligence, and hope. I share more than a name with this character. We both strive to perform well academically which leads to a great deal of independence and determination. Like Gwen, I am stubborn, strong-willed, and courageous when it comes to standing up for things I believe in. Gwen Stacy has always stood as a symbol of hope, and I believe that we share this optimistic and goal-oriented view of life. She is fierce, full of life, competent, and quite frankly beautiful. We are both on a path of self-actualization as we strengthen our minds and characters. Gwen Stacy is one of my favorite fictional characters of all time; Because of my admiration of her strengths, I have strengthened them in myself. I become more determined to make my ambitions a reality and chase my dreams. I am not afraid of defending the truth and applying my skills. I believe her grace is represented by this <a href="https://youtu.be/tFJT07-bQHc?si=vLLhpG0HYjLMw0Yh" target="_blank" title="Gwen Stacy Suite"> orchestra. </a>

        <h3>Peter Parker</h3>
        <div class="allthewayright">
            <div class="containerright">
                <div class="textalign">
                    <p class="characterpara">Aside from being my lifelong fictional crush, Peter Parker is a character that I believe represents pure integrity and perseverance. Integrity has always been the foundational principle of my character. Like Peter, I strive to always do the right thing no matter the consequences. The mission of Spider-Man is to protect the defenseless and restore peace. He is a hero because he sacrifices so much for the good of others. I have always felt a certain connection to this self-sacrifice for the right causes. I have a desire to preserve goodness and truth. Peter Parker is also brilliant, nerdy, and awkward, which I can most certainly relate to. Another aspect of Spider-Man as a character that I value is that he is human. Despite being superhuman, he still struggles, fails, and faces challenges, but he never gives up. I have tried to foster this same endurance and commitment to my callings. I always remember that with great power comes great responsibility. We have the moral obligation to do good if we are able. Peter Parker can be represented by this <a href="https://youtu.be/DJggaUrRO7A?si=z8PomEaoLKxKUBFi" target="_blank" title="Ground Rules (TASM OST)">piece.</a>

            <div class="text">
                <p class="characterpara">Mythology knows her as Megara, but “[her] friends call [her] Meg” as the film Hercules cleverly depicts. Meg has always been a comfort character for me because of her spunky nature. We are both a bit too stubborn, independent, and sarcastic for our good. Meg is an example of a woman who possesses incredible strength in shouldering challenges and heartaches while still moving forward. She is not quick to trust, which is yet another trait I see in myself, but when the right person comes along she will risk it all for them. Meg stands for what is right even when life has treated her harshly. Another trait we both possess for better or for worse is being incredibly cynical. This is a consequence of seeing the reality of the world and not knowing how to trust fully. In both our lives though, there are those who ease our fears and allow us to express our hearts. Meg and I have a tendency to deny our true feelings in a mind over heart way. Despite these traits, we are both thoughtful, hopeful, and collected. Meg in all her beauty and determination is represented by this heart-wrenching <a href="https://youtu.be/VsYQwh2OYqw?si=_cSuor9jzlPtEopA" target="_blank" title="Meg's Garden (Hercules OST)">arrangement. </a>

                <div class="textalign">
                    <p class="characterpara">One of Disney’s greatest films has got to be Hercules for its cunning plot, lovable character, and upbeat tunes. Hercules holds a dear spot in my heart for his sensitive side despite his inhuman strength. I specifically relate to the young “Herc” portrayed by this film. Hercules feels that he doesn’t quite belong because of who he is and he desperately searches for a welcome. Like Hercules, I have always had a desire to belong but a feeling that this place was distant but discoverable. I admire Hercules' courage and confidence that he would belong one day. I am also striving to make something of myself not be accepted but to prove that “I can go the distance.” What I love the most about Hercules is the purity and tenderness of his heart. Underneath his muscles, lies the true character and honor of this hero. It is not his physical capacities that make him a work of art, but the matters of his heart. He is selfless, brave, and gentle. I feel that I too am much more below the surface. My true character is found in my desires, passions, and feelings. Hercules’ conviction to be good can be summarized by this stunning <a href="https://youtu.be/6Bb9L3ITgq8?si=5nWv2HR6T3bb_nTa" target="_blank"  title="Songs as Conversations">quartet.</a>

            <div class="text">
                <p class="characterpara">Anne Shirly of Anne of Green Gables, a beloved classic, is a character that I would deem a kindred spirit. Our first similarity can be found in our love of romanticizing the world around us. Anne is often found admiring and describing the beauty around her. In a similar fashion, I am in constant awe of the beauty of the clouds, sky, and waters. We share a passion for learning and achieving our dreams quickly and independently. We share a similar eloquence in our speech and a knack for blowing things out of proportion. She is the kind of character that makes you feel warm inside because of her goodness and imagination. She is a blessing to all whose lives she is a part of. Another connection between the two of us is our inability to accept our feelings at the risk of dampening our ambition. We are both so ambitious that it can be hard to foster relationships and settle down. Life gave Anne the chance to learn many wonderful lessons that I am experiencing right now. I strive to be as bubbly, creative, and sturdy as Miss Shirly. Anne is encompassed by this majestic <a href="https://youtu.be/NrLzO6C7toc?si=_AZ98dLThfKY8Ne0" target="_blank" title="Theme from Anne of Green Gables">work.</a>

                    <p class="characterpara">Gilbert Blythe, aside from being a tease, is a man of ambition, drive, and curiosity. Gil and I share a humorous temperament but a fierce competitive spirit when it comes to excelling. Gilbert is a hard and diligent worker in whatever he applies himself to, and I have seen this to be true of myself as well. Once Gilbert’s mind is made, it is made. I have found myself to be quite blunt like Mister Blythe, who cannot seem to hold his tongue when his values are challenged. I admire his loyalty to his values and desires. We both simply speak our minds. He never seems to quit even when challenging circumstances arise. Gilbert is also a tender and gentle individual despite his often intimidating expression. I feel that Gil and I share a stoicism and serious demeanor that hides a much kinder heart inside. Gilbert is intelligent, strong, and feisty, which makes him a catch to all who know what to look for. I believe that his goodness is represented by this <a href="https://youtu.be/aD7Mq4slwTk?si=NAwcKyBFBfozjEHY" target="_blank" title="A Gentle Sunlight">song. </a>

            <div class="text">
                <p class="characterpara">Kyo Sohma is a character that is representative of a fierce determination to truly live. Despite the constricting realities of his life, Kyo works hard to improve every facet of his character. Focused study has crafted him into an excellent student and a powerful martial artist. Like Kyo, I strive to be disciplined in all areas of my life. I am strengthening my character incrementally as I take steps forward. Kyo has a bit of a rough exterior, a bit of a temper, and hidden sorrows and griefs, but behind all of this he is a tender-hearted and eager listener. He knows how to offer a helping hand, a word of comfort, and reassurance. He knows just how to lift others up even when he feels no hope for himself. I believe that I also have the ability to listen carefully and eagerly. We both seem to aid others in their challenge while hiding our own. I relate to his persistent feelings of being a burden to others but I also share his determination to rise above them. Kyo goes through a journey of healing that stretches him greatly, but he is refined and delivered. Kyo’s heart and true self is revealed in this soft <a href="https://youtu.be/wp9x7sJE4QA?si=qXSg6VH-apnz0FZv" target="_blank" title="I Will Become the Cat">tune. </a>

                <div class="textalign">
                    <p class="characterpara">Tohru Honda melts my heart with her unrelenting kindness, concern, and selflessness. She is the embodiment of wonder and goodness. This would be too much to say about myself, but I do relate to the hope and joy she finds in life. I too see life as worthwhile. It is something to invite and find immense happiness in. Tohru is one of the hardest workers portrayed in the show Fruits Basket. She helps others in a self-sacrificing manner that I sometimes find present in myself. I admire her strength to not only progress herself, but to tenderly guide all in their journeys of healing. She makes people whole by inviting them in with perfect understanding and love. Like Tohru, I strive to give everything my best effort whether it be school, work, or relationships. I strive to be a place of refuge for my dear friends and family as we work together to improve. Tohru represents pressing forward and accepting yourself for your goodness. I reached a point where I feel that I am an advocate for these same transforming ideals. Tohru Honda is beautifully depicted by this simple yet heart-warming piece of <a href="https://youtu.be/8wJY9KfnCl8?si=NFqwNIhLE1Yj0PDc" target="_blank" title="My Worth">music.</a>
